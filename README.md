# HeroWiki
A program that lets the user select a pool of heroes from the popular video game "Dota 2", in which information is shown about the unique hero. Information is webscraped from the official dota website using BeautifulSoup, TKinter is used for the GUI. Future goal to incorporate more of the scraped information into the interface as I have only scratched the surface and perhaps update it into a phone application.
